#Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Coursera Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data."

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

##Files

The code assumes all data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

**CodeBook.md** describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

**run_analysis.R** contains the code to perform the analysis described in the 5 steps. This is launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output file is called **averages_data.txt**.
